## 3.1 Churn prediction project

### Churn Prediction
- "Churn" is the process of stopping to rely on the services of one company and moving to another company for those services 
- Predicting which customers are about to churn
- Cusomters are scored with probabilities to find out which customer is most likely to churn
- Goal is to find possible causes of "churn" and how to mitigate them, in order to hold a customer
    - **Example:** Sending a customer a promotional email with an interesting offer
- Churn Prediction is a `Binary Classification`-Problem

### Binary Classification
$$g(x_i) \approx y_i$$
- $x_i$: $i$-th customer (it's features)
- $y_i\in\{0, 1\}$: Binary label 

At inference you obtain the likelihood of churning from the model $g(x_i)$, which is in $[0, 1]$.
