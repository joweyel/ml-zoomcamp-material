## 8.1 Fashion classification

In previous sections we have used tabular data. Tabular data is as the name implies saved in tabular form and therefore easily readable for python-packages like pandas. Tables have already pre-defined features with filled in values for those features. The data used in this section can't be stored in this form, since images are used. Images don't have a unified feature-representation and therefore require a different form of machine learning algorithm than before. 

- **Use-Case:** `Fashion classification service`
    - A user should be able to upload a picture and the machine learning model should return the category of clothing (multi-class)
- **Dataset**: `Clothing dataset (full, high resolution)` from Kaggle
    - Full dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/agrigorev/clothing-dataset-full
    - Subset: https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset-small
